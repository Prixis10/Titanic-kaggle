# 🛳️ Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning with comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering.

## Overview 📜

This repository contains my solutions and analyses for the Kaggle competition ["Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview 🧩

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization 🔍

- Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Visualize important features to identify patterns and relationships that might influence survival rates.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 🔧

- Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
- Engineer new features and transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
- Normalize and scale features as necessary.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation 🤖

- Implement multiple machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and more.
- Evaluate models using cross-validation and various performance metrics to select the best model.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 4. Submission 📤

- Generate predictions for the test dataset using the selected model.
- Format the predictions according to Kaggle’s submission requirements.
- Submit the results to Kaggle and review the leaderboard position.
