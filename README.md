# Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning with comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions and analyses for the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using various machine learning techniques.

## Contents

- `gender_submission.csv`: File used for analyzing survival based on gender, primarily for data analysis purposes.
- `test.csv`: Dataset containing test cases.
- `titanic_submission.csv`: Predictions generated by my model, formatted for submission to Kaggle.
- `Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the code and models for the task, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- `train.csv`: Dataset containing training cases used to train the model.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
